            <h2>Oracle Internship</h2>
            <h3>Solutions Engineering</h3>
            <h4>June 2020 - August 2020</h4>
            <p>Last summer, I worked as a remote Solutions Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html">Oracle</a>. During this time, I gained experience within Oracle Supply Chain Management and Human Capital Management Cloud products. As an intern on a team of Solutions Engineers, we were taught the ins and outs of the cloud products and then given the opportunity to shadow on customer calls. These customer calls ranged from with Solution Engineers to Business Development Consultants. We were exposed to customer research, remote presentations, objection handling, and demonstrations of solutions. As a final project, we presented a mock demo for a team of employees to critique.</p>
