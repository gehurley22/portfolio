            <p>The School of Information is known for looking at the "intersection between people, information, and technology". Regarding this, UMSI gives the skills to analyze this relationship, mostly based in Python. Starting in the second semester of my freshman year, I have been taking Data Oriented Programming classes through UMSI, prior to being enrolled in the program. Through the two courses during my freshman and sophomore years, I gained experience in data structures, debugging, testing, processing, and parsing through data. Moving into my first semester in the UMSI program, we have begun data manipulation courses where I have learned how to gather and summarize data through Python modules. This entails using regex, Pandas, SQL, and Spark to create dataframes or tables with given data. Moving into my final semesters at the University of Michigan, I am given the opportunity to expand on these skills in more indepth classes.</p>

            <p>I have been taking Spanish classes since kindergarden and plan to continue until my graduation in the Spring of 2022. I am pursuing the Spanish Language, Literature, and Culture minor, which means that I have to complete a variety of classes including three literature and three elective classes. So far, I have gained experience in classes ranging from film-based culture in Latin America to literature in Post-Franco Spain. I always planned to study abroad in Madrid in the second semester of my junior year, where I would be able to use the skills gained in my minor to immerse in the culture. Unfortunately, due to the Covid19 pandemic, I will not have this opportunity. However, in the future, I look forward to hopefully traveling to Spain and Latin America to have this experience.</p>

            <p>During first semester of my junior year, I was required to complete the core classes of my major. This included a Web Design, Development, and Accessibilty class where we learned how to apply HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the POUR principles of accessible design. This means that along with learning how to develop and design a website, we were also given the skills to create accessible websites. Within this HTML and CSS, we also looked into validators, wireframes, grid, flexbox, transformations, and transitions.</p>
