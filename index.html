    <div class ="intro">
        <p>I am a junior at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor studying in the School of Information. <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">The School of Information</a> is a two year Bachelor of Science program that allows the unique opportunity to engage in the interaction between humans and technology. I am focused on the Information Analysis pathway within the program, and am currently pursuing a minor in Spanish in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class ="interests">
        <p>What led me to the UMSI program was my passion for helping others, through practicing my one of my other passions: working with technology. I am driven to solve issues in my personal and professional life. I am confident in my ability to understand specific pain points of others. Regardless of the situation, I will aim to find the most effective solution for our customers. In the future, I would like to be in the position where I can use this ability, and the skills Iâ€™ve gained in my degree, to help others succeed in their own endeavors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class ="future">
        <p>Next summer, I will be working as a Technology Consulting Intern at <a href="https://www.pwc.com/">PwC</a> in the New York City office. I am passionate about the work that they do and I cannot wait to get started!</p>
